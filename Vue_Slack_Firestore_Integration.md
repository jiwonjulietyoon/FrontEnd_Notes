# Building a Chatbot with Slack, Firestore, and Vue.js

This post mostly focuses on the **front-end web** aspect of building a (KakaoTalk-cloned) chatbot, as well as the overall process of **integrating Slack, Firestore, and Vue.js**. 

This post does NOT discuss chatbot training with AI/machine learning, i.e the core model that constitutes a relevant chatbot response based on the user input.

Conversations between the user and the chatbot will be visually rendered on a Vue CLI project (the Kakao chatroom clone), but the actual conversation logic will be running via Slack API, Python, and Flask.
