# Building a Chatbot with Slack, Firestore, and Vue.js

### Intro

This post mostly focuses on the **front-end web** aspect of building a (KakaoTalk-cloned) chatbot, as well as the overall process of **integrating Slack, Firestore, and Vue.js**. 

This post does NOT discuss chatbot training with AI/machine learning, i.e the core model that constructs a relevant chatbot response based on the user input.

Conversations between the user and the chatbot will be visually rendered on a Vue CLI project (the Kakao chatroom clone), but the actual conversation logic will be running via Slack API, Python, and Flask.

The initial goal of this chatbot project was to enable conversations between users and bots via Slack, but I wanted to build a separate chatting platform so that I could have more flexibility with the UI/UX. Hence the Kakao chatroom clone was built.
